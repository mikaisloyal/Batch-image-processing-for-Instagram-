This is a small script to crop images in a folder, convert them to black-white and add a watermark image to them.

This code loops through all image files in a folder and makes changes(converting to black-white, cropping to a set dimensions, adding a watermark) in them. The editted files will be saved in the same folder, but with addition of "eddited_" to the name of the initial file.

If you want to run this code you will need to change a folder path and a watermark image path to the the ones that you have in your PC.
